##📊 Pricing, Rating Reliability, and Demand Concentration Analysis in Online Food Delivery Platforms
Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end Excel-based data analytics analysis of online food delivery data. The focus is on understanding pricing patterns, customer rating reliability, and geographic demand concentration across cities and food categories.

##Problem Statement

Online food delivery platforms rely on pricing strategies and customer ratings to influence customer purchase decisions. However, ratings may not always be reliable due to low review counts, and pricing behavior can vary significantly across cities and food categories.

This project analyzes restaurant pricing, customer ratings, and category-wise demand to identify patterns, assess rating reliability, and uncover city-level demand concentration risks using real-world food delivery data.

##Objectives

Analyze pricing distribution across food categories and cities

Evaluate the reliability of customer ratings using rating count thresholds

Identify demand concentration across cities and categories

Provide actionable business insights for decision-making

##Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

Excel formulas and slicers

##Key Insights

Veg items consistently account for approximately 67–68% of listings across months, indicating a stable category-level pattern rather than short-term fluctuations.

Karnataka emerges as the highest contributing state, while other high-performing states are distributed across different regions.

Sales trends are more consistent at the monthly level than at the daily level, where patterns vary across months.

Weekly analysis shows relatively higher and more stable activity during middle weeks, while the first and last weeks tend to vary.

Customer ratings are sometimes associated with low rating counts, which limits their reliability when interpreted in isolation. Ratings are more meaningful when considered alongside review volume.

##Business Implications

Pricing and promotional strategies should focus on mid-range price segments, where demand is concentrated.

Recommendation and ranking systems should consider rating counts along with rating scores to improve reliability.

Regional growth strategies should avoid over-dependence on a single state despite strong performance in Karnataka.

##Limitations

Order quantity data was unavailable; record frequency was used as a proxy for demand.

Customer-level behavior analysis was not possible due to the absence of user-specific data.

##Future Scope

Extend the analysis using SQL for scalable querying

Build interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
