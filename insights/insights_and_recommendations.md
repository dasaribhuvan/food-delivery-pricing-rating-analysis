## Key Insights
- Veg items consistently account for approximately 67–68% of listings across months, indicating a stable category-level pattern.
- Sales performance varies by month rather than by day, with no consistent weekday dominance observed.
- Karnataka emerges as the top contributing state, while other high-performing states are geographically distributed.
- Customer ratings should be interpreted alongside rating counts, as high ratings with low review volume may be unreliable.

## Business Implications
- Focus pricing and promotions on mid-range segments where demand is concentrated.
- Incorporate rating count thresholds in recommendation systems to improve ranking reliability.
- Adopt region-specific growth strategies instead of over-relying on a single state.

## Limitations
- Order quantity data was unavailable; record frequency was used as a proxy.
- Customer-level behavior could not be analyzed.

## Future Scope
- Extend analysis using SQL and Power BI for scalable reporting.
